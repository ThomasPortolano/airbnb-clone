# Airbnb clone

This project was a chance for me to explore a few critical topics:
- The concept of props and reusable functions
- Allowing me to store data in a separate data file
- Then mapping through the data and retrieving the information
- And rendering dynamically blocks in the DOM

The next project will be a solo project, a travel journal. 

Happy coding!
